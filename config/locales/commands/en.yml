        long_desc: >
          This command allows you to kill a process by its PID (Process ID).
          An example of when you would use this command is when a process is 
          not responding (e.g. a zombie Rails server instance) or consuming 
          too many resources and locking the UI of a specific application. The
          PID is a numeric value e.g. `1234` and can be found in the system 
          process list (or someplace like your Rails console output in your IDE).
