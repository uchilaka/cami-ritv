      lookup:
        short_desc: Lookup a service by its name
        long_desc: >
          This command allows you to lookup services for the CAMI app, \
          listing resources like the port number and PID file.
        no_port_specified_msg: >
          No port number was specified. Please specify a port number \
          using the --port option to lookup the service process.
      kill:
        short_desc: Kill a service by its listening port
        long_desc: >
          This command allows you to kill a service by its listening port. \
          An example of when you would use this command is when a service is \
          not responding (e.g. a zombie Rails server instance) or consuming \
          too many resources and locking the UI of a specific application. \

          The request to kill service `%{service}` has been completed. If you were

        options:
          port:
            short_desc: The port number of the service to kill
            long_desc: >
              The port number is a numeric value e.g. `3000` and can be found in the
              system process list (or someplace like your Rails console output in your IDE).
      kill_process:
        short_desc: Kill a process by its PID
        long_desc: >
          This command allows you to kill a process by its PID (Process ID).
          An example of when you would use this command is when a process is
          not responding (e.g. a zombie Rails server instance) or consuming
          too many resources and locking the UI of a specific application. The
          PID is a numeric value e.g. `1234` and can be found in the system
          process list (or someplace like your Rails console output in your IDE).
