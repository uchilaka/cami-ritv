          # Tailscale
          Fast, seamless device connectivity â€” no hardware, no firewall rules,
          no wasted time.

          ## Discovery story
          I first heard about Tailscale when looking into more price-competitive
          alternatives for NGROK. A cheekily worded Google search targeted ad led
          me to Tailscale's website, and I was intrigued by the set of features for
          their free tier, as well as their value proposition to developers and
          small teams.

    tailscale.save!
    puts "ðŸª„ Created vendor: #{tailscale.display_name} [#{tailscale.slug}]" if tailscale.persisted?
  end

  def down
    Vendor.find_by(slug: 'tailscale')&.destroy
